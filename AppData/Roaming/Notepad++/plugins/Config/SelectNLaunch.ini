; Select 'N' Launch plugin allows you to convert the selected text to whatever you want, launch it on the fly
; You should define the document type (by extension) you want to launch and voila.
;
; What Select 'N' Launch plugin does is writing the selected text into a temporary file with the extension you defined,
; then run shellExecute to launch it.
;
; Example: if you need to check a certificate in a XAdES signature document,
; or a PDF document encoded in base 64 in your text file, you just need to define your command name, the extension (crt or pdf in our context),
; and buildin convertion function (optional, "b64decode" is needed for launching a PDF document if your pdf is encoded in base64).
;
; built-in convertion function :
; 1. b64decode

[Selection to PDF]
ext=pdf

[Base64 to PDF]
ext=pdf
convertFunc=b64decode

[Selection to Certificate]
ext=crt

[Selection to CRL]
